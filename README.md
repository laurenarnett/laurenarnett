### Hi there, I'm Lauren ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**laurenarnett/laurenarnett** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started: -->

I graduated as a Computer Science major from Columbia University in 2019. I have been working as a Full-Stack Software Developer since then, using Java, Clojure, and ClojureScript. I'm currently in a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), where I'm making lots of Haskell projects and trying out [IHP](https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/).

<!-- - ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ... -->
- ðŸŒ± Currently learning: Haskell; SIMD & working with vector intrinsics
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for work in **Backend Engineering** roles 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: CFG parsing reduces to Boolean matrix multiplication [(Lee, 2002)](https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0112018), meaning that the fastest parsing algorithms can be computed in less than O(n^3)!

You can find more details about me and ways to reach out at [laurenar.net](https://laurenar.net)!
